Plainion.JekyllLint is developed based on the .NET framework 4.7 in F#.

All dependencies are handled via NuGet.

Tests are written in [NUnit](http://nunit.org/). I recommend [NUnit 3 Test Adapter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NUnitDevelopers.NUnit3TestAdapter)
for Visual Studio to run the tests. Of course you can also run the tests with NUnit runners directly.
